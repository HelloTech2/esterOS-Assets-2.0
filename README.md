Well, it is not fake but, like any OS, it takes too long to finish and release it to the public.\
Cuz people keep forgetting :skull:

 - This is an Arch distro
 - It uses Gnome<sup>visually appealing edition</sup>
	 - Has a custom made icon pack
	 - Has a custom boot animation
	 - Has a custom font
	 - Has custom wallpapers
  	 - Use adw-gtk3 theme
	 - ***WILL*** have custom apps
 - It is indeed real. (Atleast on the PC version  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`)

> - "Auto-Correct Embarrassment."
> - "Ctrl+Alt+Del Syndrome" – a condition where you start believing that restarting yourself will solve all of life's problems.
